  "description": "Interaction with UI mutation is usability 101 level stuff. Web developers should always keep this in mind to let user realize which element has beeb tapped. I like Google Material Design's ripple effect when user taped some clickable elements, suh as <a />„ÄÅ<button />. That's why I deign <msc-ripple /> to wrap clickable elements and let them have ripple effect after user tapped. Besides that, <msc-ripple /> also provide sound & vibrate options to let developers decide turn them on or not.",
